# Hangman
This is a revised version of the classic game of hangman. This one-player game allows the user to play against the computer, where the computer thinks of a word and the user can try to outwit it. The user enters one letter at a time, until they have guessed the chosen word, or lost all their lives.
This game was made in Python.
